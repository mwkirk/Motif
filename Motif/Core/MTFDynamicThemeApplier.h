/**
 A dynamic theme applier enables dynamic theming, allowing the objects that are
 themed to have a new theme reapplied to them by simply changing the theme
 property on the dynamic theme applier that initially applied their theme class.
 
 When using a MTFDynamicThemeApplier, you should not use the 
 applyClassWithName:to:error: method on MTFTheme to apply theme classes to
 objects. Instead, use the method on MTFDynamicThemeApplier.
 
 If the `theme` property is changed on an `MTFDynamicThemeApplier`, it reapplies
 the theme classes that were previously applied by it with classes from the new
 theme. If some classes are unavailable in the new theme, they are ignored, and
 no style is applied to the object.
